# SimpleCalcuatorApp
Here's a simple calculator app I made for my OOP in Java class.
Strong implementation of form + function:
- design inspo from keyboard numpad and apple's calculator.
- utilized self-written createSubstring() function for efficient user experience (i.e calculator result string shows double or int data type as necessary, all of the user input is shown in display before enter button is pressed).
